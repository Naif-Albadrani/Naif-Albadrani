How to make this gif ?

I made my with https://codesandbox.io/s/github-profile-2ijk7
Then i recorded my screen to gif on Mac with Quicktime  and save result to [assets/github.mov](assets/github.mov)
This [gist](https://gist.github.com/tskaggs/6394639) help me to create a dedicated command that convert MOV to GIF.
Type this command `make generate-gif` to generate [assets/github.gif](assets/github.gif)
