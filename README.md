How to make this gif?

I made mine with https://codesandbox.io/s/github-profile-2ijk7  
Then I recorded my screen to gif on Mac with QuickTime and saved the result to [assets/github.mov](assets/github.mov)  
This [gist](https://gist.github.com/tskaggs/6394639) helped me to create a dedicated command that converts MOV to GIF.  
Type this command `make generate-gif` to generate [assets/github.gif](assets/github.gif)
